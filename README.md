## üìä Initial Data Exploration
![IDA](https://github.com/caesarmario/customer-rating-prediction-using-SAS-Enterprise-Miner/blob/main/Screenshot/02%20-%20Initial%20Data%20Exploration.png)
   - There are no missing values detected for character and numerical columns.
   - However, the skewness for Tax_5%, Total, cogs, and gross_income have right-skewed distribution. <br>

![Pearson Corr](https://github.com/caesarmario/customer-rating-prediction-using-SAS-Enterprise-Miner/blob/main/Screenshot/03%20-%20Pearson%20Correlation%20Statistics.png)
   - All continuous variables in the dataset do not correlate with the rating because the correlation value is close to 0 even though the correlation value is negative. <br>

![Statistical Exploration](https://github.com/caesarmario/customer-rating-prediction-using-SAS-Enterprise-Miner/blob/main/Screenshot/04%20-%20Statistical%20Exploration.png)
   - This node will explore variables that can not entered StatExplore node.
   - It can be seen that the four variables do not have missing values in the dataset.
   - The minimum, maximum, and mean values in gross margin percentage have the same value, namely 4.761905 (it happens since it has same values for all observations). <br>

![Pearson Corr](https://github.com/caesarmario/customer-rating-prediction-using-SAS-Enterprise-Miner/blob/main/Screenshot/03%20-%20Pearson%20Correlation%20Statistics.png)
   - All continuous variables in the dataset do not correlate with the rating because the correlation value is close to 0 even though the correlation value is negative. <br>

### üìè Linear Regression
#### 1Ô∏è‚É£üìè Standard Linear Regression
![Standard LR](https://github.com/caesarmario/customer-rating-prediction-using-SAS-Enterprise-Miner/blob/main/Screenshot/15%20-%20Standard%20LR.png)<br>
![ANOVA Standard LR](https://github.com/caesarmario/customer-rating-prediction-using-SAS-Enterprise-Miner/blob/main/Screenshot/16%20-%20ANOVA%20Standard%20LR.png)
   - RMSE value for training is 1.73, for validation is 1.712, whereas the RMSE value for testing is 1.746.
   - The p-value from ANOVA table is 0.9250 (> 0.05), which can be concluded that the independent variables do not exhibit a statistically significant connection with the dependent variable, or the independent variables do not predict the dependent variable dependably.
   - The value of R-square is 0.0180, which means this result shows that the independent variable can be used to predict just 1.8% of the variation in ratings (dependent variable).<br>

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£üìè Forward Linear Regression
![Forward LR](https://github.com/caesarmario/customer-rating-prediction-using-SAS-Enterprise-Miner/blob/main/Screenshot/18%20-%20Forward%20LR.png)<br>
![ANOVA Forward LR](https://github.com/caesarmario/customer-rating-prediction-using-SAS-Enterprise-Miner/blob/main/Screenshot/17%20-%20ANOVA%20Forward%20LR.png)
   - The RMSE value for training is 1.71, for validation is 1.733, whereas the RMSE value for testing is 1.723.
   - The p-value and r-square obtained error or did not appear.<br>

![ANOVA Stepwise LR](https://github.com/caesarmario/customer-rating-prediction-using-SAS-Enterprise-Miner/blob/main/Screenshot/20%20-%20ANOVA%20Stepwise%20LR.png)
   - RMSE value for training is 1.71, for validation is 1.733, whereas the RMSE value for testing is 1.723.
   - The p-value and r-square obtained error or did not appear.<br>

![Backward LR](https://github.com/caesarmario/customer-rating-prediction-using-SAS-Enterprise-Miner/blob/main/Screenshot/21%20-%20Backward%20LR.png)<br>
![ANOVA Backward LR](https://github.com/caesarmario/customer-rating-prediction-using-SAS-Enterprise-Miner/blob/main/Screenshot/22%20-%20ANOVA%20Backward%20LR.png)
   - RMSE value for training is 1.71, for validation is 1.733, whereas the RMSE value for testing is 1.723.
   - There are 15 steps performed in this model, and based on the resulting p-value, there are no independent variables that affect the rating value (dependent variable) since the p-value is more than 0.05.
   - The p-value and r-square obtained error or did not appear.<br>
